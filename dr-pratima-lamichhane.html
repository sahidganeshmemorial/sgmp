                With a steadfast commitment to academic excellence and professional growth, my educational journey has been marked by consistent achievement and dedication. I began my formal education at Chitrawan English Boarding School in Chitwan, where I earned my School Leaving Certificate (S.L.C.) in 2010, securing a First Division.

            <p>
                With a rich tapestry of professional experiences spanning nearly a decade, I have cultivated a diverse and profound expertise in the medical field.

Following this, I embarked on an enriching Internship Programme at LMC, which spanned from May 30, 2022, to May 29, 2023. This period was instrumental in broadening my clinical acumen and reinforcing my commitment to patient-centered care. Currently, I am contributing my skills and knowledge at the prestigious Manmohan Cardiothoracic and Transplant Center in Kathmandu, affiliated with Tribhuvan University, where I continue to thrive in a dynamic and challenging environment.

My commitment to community health is reflected in my participation in medical camps, such as those conducted in NJS and Ruru VDC in collaboration with LMC and other organizations, where I provided essential healthcare services to underserved populations.
            </p>
            <p>
                To stay at the forefront of medical knowledge, I have attended continuing medical education (CME) sessions on critical topics including hypertension, depression, effective communication strategies for delivering difficult news, and advanced nutritional support techniques such as total enteral and parenteral nutrition. My dedication to public health is further underscored by my involvement in various social service initiatives in rural areas, aimed at improving healthcare access and outcomes.

            <p>
                Furthermore, I have completed WHO-endorsed training programs focused on emerging respiratory viruses, including COVID-19, covering detection, prevention, response, and control measures, as well as infection prevention and control (IPC) protocols specific to the novel coronavirus. These experiences have not only enriched my clinical acumen but also reinforced my commitment to addressing global health challenges through education, leadership, and community engagement.
