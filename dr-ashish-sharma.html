            <h3>Personal Information</h3>
            <p>
                I was born on May 8, 1993, and currently reside in Birendranagar-08, Naulapur, Surkhet, Nepal. As a Nepalese national, I take pride in my cultural heritage and identity. I am fluent in multiple languages, including Nepali (my native language), English, and Hindi, and I also have a proficient understanding of Deutsch (German). My multilingual abilities enable me to communicate effectively in diverse cultural and professional settings.
            </p>

            <!-- Academic Qualification -->
            <h3>Academic Qualification</h3>
            <p>
                My academic journey has been both enriching and transformative, marked by dedication and a passion for learning. It began with the School Leaving Certificate (S.L.C.) from SOS Hermann Gmeiner Higher Secondary School in Surkhet, where I graduated with First Division honors in 2008. This foundational phase instilled in me a strong work ethic and a love for academic excellence. I then pursued my Higher Secondary Education (H.S.E.B.) at Xavier International Higher Secondary School in Kathmandu, graduating with First Division in 2010. The vibrant and diverse environment at Xavier broadened my horizons and nurtured my critical thinking skills.
            </p>
            <p>
                My passion for medicine led me to enroll in the MBBS program at Lumbini Medical College in Palpa, affiliated with Kathmandu University. Graduating with First Division in 2016 was a milestone that filled me with immense pride and a sense of accomplishment. The rigorous training, hands-on clinical experience, and exposure to diverse medical cases during my MBBS years were both challenging and rewarding, shaping me into a confident and compassionate medical professional.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2018, I achieved another significant milestone by passing the Nepal Medical Council (N.M.C.) licensing examination on January 28, earning my permanent registration with NMC number 21425. This achievement marked the official beginning of my medical career, allowing me to contribute meaningfully to the healthcare sector. Each step of my academic journey has been a blend of hard work, perseverance, and unforgettable experiences that have prepared me for the challenges and opportunities in the field of medicine.

            <!-- Work Journey and Experiences -->
            <h3>Work Journey and Experiences</h3>
            <p>
                My professional journey in the medical field has been both diverse and fulfilling, marked by hands-on experience, continuous learning, and a commitment to serving communities. It began with a one-year internship at Lumbini Medical College and Teaching Hospital Ltd., completed between January 24, 2017, and January 23, 2018. This immersive experience allowed me to apply my academic knowledge in real-world settings, honing my skills in emergency medical procedures such as endotracheal intubation, CPR, poisoning management, and general surgical techniques. Following my internship, I served as a Medical Officer at DCWC Community Hospital for two years (January 29, 2018, to January 30, 2020), where I managed a wide range of medical and surgical cases, including thoracocentesis, paracentesis, catheterization, lumbar punctures, and minor surgical procedures. This role deepened my clinical expertise and reinforced my ability to work under pressure.
            </p>
            <p>
                From February 1, 2020, to January 30, 2023, I contributed to USAID’s Strengthening Systems for Better Health (SSBH) Activity under Abt Associates Inc. as an Emergency Medical Response Doctor. This consultancy role was a transformative experience, allowing me to design and deliver emergency medical services while collaborating with stakeholders and third parties. I also organized training sessions and Continuing Medical Education (CME) programs for healthcare workers, fostering a culture of knowledge-sharing and professional growth. My role required strong presentation skills, data interpretation, and research abilities, which I developed further during this period.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, I serve as a Permanent Member and Medical Planning and Execution Officer at Shahid Ganesh Memorial Pratisthan in Karnali Province, Nepal, a role I began on August 3, 2023. These roles have allowed me to expand my expertise in medical planning, execution, and community healthcare delivery. My journey has been enriched by my ability to adapt, learn, and innovate, making me a well-rounded medical professional dedicated to improving healthcare outcomes.

            <!-- Trainings and Achievements -->
            <h3>Trainings and Achievements</h3>
            <p>
                My professional journey has been enriched by a wide array of trainings and achievements that have significantly enhanced my clinical expertise and leadership capabilities. I have been actively involved in the screening, prevention, diagnosis, and management of various common medical problems at both rural and national levels, ensuring comprehensive healthcare delivery. My experience in managing critical medical cases in ICU settings has equipped me with the skills to handle high-pressure situations with precision and care. Additionally, I have had the privilege of contributing to undergraduate medical education through bedside teaching, fostering the next generation of healthcare professionals.
            </p>
            <p>
                Leadership and public speaking have been integral to my career, enabling me to effectively communicate and collaborate with diverse teams. I have completed vocational trainings in essential areas such as the management of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH), Helping Babies Breathe, and hand hygiene, and have successfully organized and managed numerous workshops. My involvement in health camps and social services, particularly in rural areas, has deepened my understanding of community healthcare needs. I have also attended and contributed to Continuing Medical Education (CME) programs on critical topics such as hypertension, depression, breaking bad news, and enteral and parenteral nutrition.
            </p>
            <p>
                Further enriching my expertise, I have participated in national-level seminars on surgery and gynecology and completed the Community-Based Integrated Management of Neonatal and Childhood Illness (CB-IMNCI) training. My commitment to staying at the forefront of medical knowledge is reflected in my completion of WHO-based trainings on emerging respiratory viruses, including COVID-19 detection, prevention, response, and control, as well as Infection Prevention and Control (IPC). I have also undergone specialized trainings in dead body management, ICU care, and respiratory management under USAID’s guidance.
            </p>
            <p>
                In collaboration with USAID and the Provincial Health Service Office, I have organized and led various trainings, health camps, and CME programs for healthcare workers and stakeholders at both rural and provincial levels. These initiatives have focused on critical areas such as IPC for COVID-19, quality control, breaking bad news, and specialized training for ambulance drivers and Nepal Army personnel on dead body management. These experiences have not only broadened my skill set but also reinforced my dedication to improving healthcare systems and outcomes.
            </p>
            <img src="ashish training.jpg" alt="Training Photo" class="content-img">
<p>I have always been fascinated by the mysteries of life and death, which is why I developed a deep interest in the field of medicine. My life’s journey has been profoundly influenced by Osho’s philosophy, which I greatly admire. I have read, listened to, and actively participated in his teachings, which have transformed my life as an Osho devotee. This journey of self-discovery led me to contribute my quality time to book reading, often supporting local book stalls that promote spiritual and philosophical literature. This passion for knowledge and community also inspired me to help many students learn meditation and discover inner peace. With the support of our team and the blessings of Bhagwan, we established the Osho Commune in Palpa.</p>

<p>Parallel to my spiritual pursuits, I am extremely willing to help disabled people by advocating for their health, hygiene, and overall well-being, believing that compassion in action is the highest form of service. Beyond this, my deep love for nature drives me to protect the environment as a cornerstone of sustainable living. Alongside like-minded friends, I visit barren lands to plant trees, an activity that brings immense joy and fulfillment as we contribute to our planet’s healing.</p>

<p>Through these endeavors—whether nurturing minds with wisdom, supporting vulnerable communities, or healing the Earth—I strive to live a life rooted in purpose, service, and harmony with existence.
I have a deep love for nature, and I believe protecting the environment is essential for sustainable living. Along with some like-minded friends, I visit different places to plant trees, especially in open, barren lands. This activity brings us immense joy and fulfillment, as it contributes to the well-being of our planet.</p>
